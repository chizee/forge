# Changelog

All notable changes to forge are documented here.

## [0.8.1] — 2026-07-10

A bug-fix release for the llamafile backend. When llama.cpp's tool-call parser rejects malformed model output with a 500, the raw error JSON no longer leaks into the conversation as assistant text — complete tool calls are rescued out of the error body and executed, and unrecoverable ones trigger a clean re-sample nudge.

### Added
- **Tool-call rescue from malformed-500 bodies.** llama.cpp's `Failed to parse input` message embeds the rejected generation; forge now leniently re-parses `<tool_call>` blocks out of it (Qwen-coder XML format) and returns each block that names a tool from the request's `tools` array as a real `ToolCall` — deduped, with parameters coerced to their declared schema types. Skeleton/preview blocks are passed through too: dispatch rejects them with a `[ToolError]` on the tool channel, the canonical corrective signal, while complete calls simply execute. Unknown tool names are never fabricated. Rescues are counted on `LlamafileClient.rescued_tool_calls` and logged, so rescued runs stay auditable.

### Fixed
- **Malformed tool-call 500s no longer leak error JSON into the conversation.** When llama.cpp rejects a malformed or incomplete tool call and nothing can be rescued from the body, forge returns a targeted retry nudge (naming the stutter pattern when a `<tool_call>` block was visible, generic otherwise) so the retry loop re-samples a clean call. Previously the raw 500 body was echoed back as if the model had said it.

### Changed
- **Arbitrary llamafile 500s now fail loud.** A 500 that is *not* a tool-call parse rejection raises `BackendError` instead of being returned as a `TextResponse` carrying the error body — genuine backend failures now cascade, matching the other clients, rather than entering the conversation as model text.

## [0.8.0] — 2026-06-27

First-class authentication across all proxy modes and backends. forge now forwards exactly one credential to the backend — a static `--backend-api-key` or a single inbound auth header — relocating it across protocols (`x-api-key` ↔ `Authorization: Bearer`) when the frontend and backend differ. Gated OpenAI-compatible backends (LM Studio, hosted vLLM, service accounts) work without monkey-patching. Closes #119.

### Added
- **`--backend-api-key` / `FORGE_BACKEND_API_KEY`** — a static credential forge sends to the backend in its native auth slot (LM Studio, hosted providers, service accounts — the case where the caller sends nothing). Baked into the backend client at startup and relocated to the backend's protocol slot. When set, an inbound auth header is refused as a second credential.
- **Cross-protocol credential relocation** — an inbound `x-api-key` ↔ `Authorization: Bearer` is rewritten to the backend's protocol when frontend and backend differ (the SSO/forwarded-token case). Frontend protocol is by path (`/v1/chat/completions` = openai, `/v1/messages` = anthropic); backend by `--backend-protocol`. See the auth section in [Backend Setup](docs/BACKEND_SETUP.md).
- **Deferred backend discovery for gated external backends.** The context-length / served-model-name probe (llama.cpp `/props`, vLLM `/v1/models`) now runs on the **first request**, authenticated by that request's credential, instead of unauthenticated at startup — which previously 401'd and crashed boot against a gated backend. Managed mode and the Anthropic external path are unaffected. New `LLMClient.discover_backend_metadata(extra_headers)`; vLLM collapses its two `/v1/models` round-trips into one.

### Changed
- **BREAKING — credential handling for auth-required backends.** This only affects backends that *require* auth. **Ungated local backends are unchanged — leave `--backend-api-key` unset and send no auth header, exactly as before; zero credentials is the normal local path and still works.** What changed: when a backend *does* require a credential, a request carrying **zero** now fails loud (401) instead of sending an empty/garbage header that produced an opaque downstream error; and **two** credentials at once (static + inbound, or two inbound auth headers) are refused with **400** rather than one silently winning. Migration: nothing to do for local/ungated backends. For gated backends, supply exactly one credential — set `--backend-api-key` (or `FORGE_BACKEND_API_KEY`), *or* forward an inbound auth header, not both.
- **Removed the silent `extra_headers`-overrides-`api_key` merge.** A per-call auth header in `extra_headers` no longer shadows a client's configured `api_key`; that combination is now a two-credential conflict (400). Migration: pass the credential one way only. (Undocumented prior behavior, unlikely to be relied on.)

## [0.7.6] — 2026-06-20

A bug-fix release for the Ollama backend and inline reasoning capture. Multi-turn tool sessions and multi-part message content no longer 400 against Ollama's native API, and chain-of-thought emitted inline in `content` is now captured on vLLM and Ollama as it already was on the structured-field path.

### Added
- **16GB-tier MoE models** in the published eval set and dashboard (gen-3 regeneration). #107

### Changed
- **Think-tag parsing consolidated** into one shared helper (`forge.prompts.think_tags`), de-duplicating inline-reasoning extraction across the llamafile client and prompt templates. #112
- **Scripted test doubles consolidated** into a shared `conftest` fixture, replacing the per-module `MockClient` stand-ins. #76 (thanks @SuperMarioYL).

### Fixed
- **Inline `<think>` reasoning is captured on vLLM and Ollama.** When a reasoning model emits its chain-of-thought inline in `content` (`<think>…</think>`) instead of a structured reasoning field, that reasoning is now extracted onto the first tool call — matching the behavior already present for structured reasoning fields. #110
- **Ollama's native `/api/chat` accepts OpenAI-wire message shapes.** On the proxy's native-passthrough path the client's verbatim OpenAI messages reach Ollama's stricter native endpoint. Multi-part array `content` is now flattened to text, and assistant `tool_calls[].function.arguments` sent as a JSON string are coerced to objects — fixing 400s on multi-turn tool sessions and on clients that send array-shaped content. #111, #115

## [0.7.5] — 2026-06-11

Reasoning replay is now a measured, bounded policy. Reasoning-capable backends return hidden reasoning alongside tool calls, and forge previously re-serialized all of it into backend-facing history on every later turn. The new `reasoning_replay` knob bounds that — and after a full re-sweep of the published eval grid showed that dropping replayed reasoning is quality-free and token-cheaper, the default is `none`. The release also re-baselines the Claude eval tier with extended thinking enabled and adds Anthropic prompt caching with cache-aware cost accounting.

### Added
- **`reasoning_replay {full, keep-last, none}`** on `WorkflowRunner(reasoning_replay=…)` and the proxy (`--reasoning-replay`). `full` replays every captured reasoning block (the historical behavior), `keep-last` only the most recent, `none` keeps reasoning out of backend-facing history entirely. Serialization-only: reasoning is still captured and still surfaces in `on_message` and internal history. In OpenAI-compatible proxy responses, `keep-last` exposes current reasoning as `reasoning_content` rather than assistant `content`, so clients that preserve reasoning fields can replay just the latest block. See [ADR-017](docs/decisions/017-reasoning-replay-policy.md).
- **Reasoning-replay eval grid** (`eval_results_v0.7.5.jsonl`, a new eval generation): the full 8–14B lineup re-swept across all three policies × both ablations × native/prompt — ~170k runs. The policy is part of the eval resume key and a first-class report/dashboard dimension: row labels carry `:keep-last` / `:full` tags (untagged = `none`), the dashboard gains a Reasoning Replay filter, the report a `--reasoning-replay` filter, and a dedicated [reasoning-replay view](docs/results/raw/reasoning-replay.md) compares policies per config. A wire-level counter (`reasoning_wire`) validates each policy's on-wire behavior (`none` → exactly 0 replayed reasoning across every run).
- **Anthropic extended thinking — `AnthropicClient(thinking=…)`** — request-side extended-thinking config (e.g. `{"type": "adaptive"}`). When set, a forced `tool_choice` is suppressed (the API requires `auto` with thinking on) and `max_tokens` is raised to fit the thinking budget. The Claude eval baseline now runs Sonnet and Opus with adaptive thinking — all prior Claude rows had thinking off, the wrong baseline for a reasoning-flavored suite; Haiku does not support adaptive thinking and stays non-thinking.
- **Anthropic prompt caching — `AnthropicClient(prompt_caching=True)`** — marks a static ephemeral cache breakpoint over the tool definitions + system prompt (byte-identical every turn, so it read-hits from turn 2 onward instead of re-billing the re-sent schema). `TokenUsage` gains generic `cache_creation_input_tokens` / `cache_read_input_tokens` counters, and eval cost accounting prices cache writes (1.25×) and reads (0.1×) at their actual rates.

### Changed
- **Captured reasoning is no longer replayed to the backend by default.** Pre-0.7.5 behavior replayed every captured reasoning block (equivalent to `reasoning_replay="full"`); the default is now `"none"`. On the published eval suite, `none` is statistically indistinguishable from replay-all in aggregate while saving the replayed tokens every turn; no per-config regression survives multiple-comparison correction (closest: a mild raw drop on Ministral-3 14B Reasoning Q4, where `none` and `keep-last` are indistinguishable from each other). The knob is inert for models that emit no reasoning. Migration: `--reasoning-replay full` (proxy) or `WorkflowRunner(reasoning_replay="full")` restores the historical behavior. Anthropic-protocol proxy responses emit reasoning text only under `full` — forge does not synthesize signed Anthropic thinking blocks.

## [0.7.4] — 2026-06-03

Malformed tool-call arguments now self-correct on the tool-error channel, and the eval suite gains its first model-size upgrade — a 32GB tier (Qwen3.5 / 3.6 27–35B, Nemotron-3 Nano, Mistral-Small-3.2) surfaced in the dashboard alongside the existing 8–14B lineup.

### Added
- **Proxy `--max-tool-errors`** (default 2) — bounds consecutive tool-argument errors per request, mirroring the `WorkflowRunner` budget. Threaded through `ProxyServer` and the HTTP handler.
- **32GB model tier** in the published eval and dashboard: Mistral-Small-3.2 24B, Qwen3.5 27B / 35B-A3B, Qwen3.6 27B / 35B-A3B, Nemotron-3 Nano 30B-A3B (moved Unpublished → Current in the [Model Registry](docs/MODEL_REGISTRY.md)).
- **Eval-generation tracking in the dashboard.** Results gathered against different code states fold into a single view, deduped to the newest generation per config. Runs not yet re-swept (e.g. the Anthropic ablation) are carried forward and superscript-badged with a commit/date legend; Retired-tier models are carried forward but hidden behind a `Show retired` toggle.

### Changed
- **Malformed tool-call arguments ride the tool-error channel.** A model that emits a structurally valid call whose `arguments` are unparseable or not an object is now corrected via a tool-error result (`role="tool"`, anchored to its `tool_call_id`) draining `max_tool_errors`, uniformly across all OpenAI-shape clients and all three integration modes (`WorkflowRunner`, proxy, `Guardrails` facade). This supersedes 0.7.3's "malformed args drive a retry nudge" behavior. The change is a native-mode conditioning bet — a small model plausibly self-corrects better on the channel it was pretrained on than via a trailing user nudge; in prompt mode the tool role is downgraded to a user message, so behavior there is unchanged. See [ADR-016](docs/decisions/016-malformed-args-tool-error-channel.md).
- **`Guardrails.check()` gains `action="tool_error"`** for tool-call faults (unknown tool, malformed args) so middleware loops account for them on the tool channel. No consumers depended on the prior action vocabulary.
- **`ToolCall` / `TextResponse` are now plain dataclasses** (`args: Any`); arg-shape validation moved to `ResponseValidator`. Attribute access and keyword construction are unchanged — but the pydantic `.model_*` API on these two exported types is gone, and construction no longer raises on a non-dict `args`. Only affects callers that serialized these objects via pydantic or relied on construction-time validation.

### Fixed
- **Non-object tool args no longer crash the parser.** Previously `arguments` decoding to a list / scalar / `null` raised at `ToolCall` construction; it is now caught at validation and routed to the tool-error channel. `StepTracker.check_prerequisites` additionally guards against a non-dict `args` reaching a direct dispatch.

## [0.7.3] — 2026-06-01

Native-first proxy. With native function calling now well-supported across modern local models, the proxy defaults to — and is optimized for — native tool calling, forwarding the client's OpenAI `tools` / `messages` to the backend verbatim. Prompt-injection remains available as an explicit opt-in for llama.cpp / llamafile backends that lack a function-calling template, but it is no longer the default path. This release also folds in the OpenAI-compatible client and several proxy / eval fixes that landed on `main` since 0.7.2.

### Added
- **`OpenAICompatClient`** for arbitrary OpenAI-compatible endpoints. #89 (thanks @lucasgerads).
- **`--backend-timeout` proxy option** — configurable backend response timeout (default 300s). #91.
- **`--backend-capability {native,prompt}` proxy flag** — `native` (default) forwards the client's tools / messages verbatim to a function-calling-capable backend; `prompt` opts into prompt-injection for non-FC llama.cpp / llamafile backends. Declared once at startup and frozen — never probed or switched mid-stream.
- Effective `backend_timeout` logged at proxy startup.

### Changed
- **BREAKING — `--mode {native,prompt}` renamed to `--backend-capability {native,prompt}`** (and `ProxyServer(mode=…)` → `ProxyServer(backend_capability=…)`). `--mode` collided with the proxy's managed / external deployment mode; the new name states what it controls — the backend's tool-calling protocol — and reflects that the choice is declared once and frozen, never probed at runtime. There is **no deprecation alias** (`--mode` was introduced in 0.7.1). Migration: `--mode native` → drop it (native is the default) or `--backend-capability native`; `--mode prompt` → `--backend-capability prompt`.
- **Native function calling is now transparent passthrough** — the proxy forwards the client's OpenAI tool / message payloads to the backend verbatim instead of round-tripping them through forge's internal `ToolSpec` representation, which dropped schema detail.
- **vLLM model identity** consolidated to a single source of truth (the wire `model_path` and the registry `model` key are now set together). #75.
- The `prompt` capability is now **rejected loudly** for ollama / vllm / anthropic backends — previously it was silently ignored for ollama.
- `stream_options` is excluded from proxy passthrough. #94 (thanks @alexandergunnarson).

### Fixed
- **Consistent malformed-tool-call / unexpected-response handling** across the OpenAI-shape clients — malformed model tool args drive a retry (`TextResponse`) instead of degrading silently or raising inconsistently, and non-streaming responses are guarded so a broken provider envelope fails loud.
- `Guardrails.record()` no longer drops tool args for prerequisite tracking. #72 (thanks @hobostay).
- Deprecated asyncio API replaced; proxy server input validation added. #71 (thanks @hobostay).
- Proxy input hardening, non-blocking Ollama stop, client shutdown, and loud arg decode. #86.
- Dead code and a fragile variable reference cleaned up in `LlamafileClient`. #73 (thanks @hobostay).

### Removed
- Runtime `auto` function-calling mode in `LlamafileClient` — the proxy never used it, and its mid-request probe-and-switch behavior is replaced by the declared-and-frozen `--backend-capability`.

## [0.7.2] — 2026-05-24

vLLM backend support — serve AWQ/GPTQ and other vLLM-hosted models behind forge's guardrails, in both proxy modes and via `WorkflowRunner`.

### Added
- **vLLM backend (`VLLMClient`).** OpenAI-compatible client for a vLLM server, consuming vLLM's server-side `tool_calls` and `reasoning` (vLLM 0.21) fields. Native function calling only — vLLM parses tools server-side via `--enable-auto-tool-choice --tool-call-parser`, so there is no prompt-injection mode. Exported from `forge` and `forge.clients`.
- **vLLM in managed + external proxy modes.** `--backend vllm --model-path <dir|hf-repo-id>` launches and manages a vLLM server; `--backend-url <url> --backend vllm` proxies an externally managed one. `setup_backend()` / `ServerManager` gain a `model_path` parameter (the vLLM identity, distinct from `gguf_path`).
- **vLLM served-model-name discovery in external mode.** vLLM validates the request `model` field against its `--served-model-name` and 404s on a mismatch (unlike llama.cpp, which ignores the field). The proxy discovers the served name from `/v1/models` instead of sending a placeholder. #74 (thanks @srinathh).
- **vLLM section in [Backend Setup](docs/BACKEND_SETUP.md)** covering the server flags and `VLLMClient` usage.

### Changed
- **Proxy managed mode now delegates to `setup_backend()`** instead of reimplementing the server-start/budget dance, so every managed backend (including vLLM) shares one path. No public API change — `ProxyServer` and the `forge.proxy` CLI keep their v0.7.1 signatures, with `model_path` / `--model-path` and the `vllm` backend added.
- **External mode fails fast when a backend reports no context length** and no `--budget-tokens` is set, instead of silently falling back to an 8192-token budget that could truncate context. Anthropic-protocol downstreams are unaffected.

### Known limitations
- **The vLLM backend is unit-validated but was not exercised against a live vLLM server in this release cycle.** Its client and server-management code carry full unit coverage, and the proxy's protocol translation is verified end-to-end against llama.cpp (the proxy layer is backend-agnostic). `scripts/integration_test_proxy.py --vllm-url <url>` runs the full request battery against a real vLLM server when one is available.

## [0.7.1] — 2026-05-24

Proxy hardening: forge now works with Claude Code. First PyPI release to include the Docker, model-pass-through, and token-usage work that landed on `main` after v0.7.0.

### Added
- **Anthropic Messages API on the proxy (`POST /v1/messages`).** Point Claude Code — or any Anthropic-protocol client — at a forge-guarded model. Two downstream shapes: **Path 2** (default, `--backend-protocol openai`) translates Anthropic ↔ OpenAI for local llama.cpp / Ollama and emits Anthropic SSE back; **Path 1** (`--backend-protocol anthropic`, external mode) forwards to an Anthropic-shape downstream (LiteLLM, the Anthropic API, a self-hosted proxy), passing unknown fields through verbatim. Adds a `base_url` kwarg on `AnthropicClient`. See the new "Using forge with Claude Code" section in the User Guide.
- **`--mode {native,prompt}` proxy flag** — run prompt-injected function-calling through the proxy for OpenAI-compatible backends that lack a native tool-calling template, not just native FC. Closes #53.
- **Real token-usage reporting through the proxy** — responses carry actual prompt/completion counts (previously hardcoded zeros), in both OpenAI (`usage.prompt_tokens/...`) and Anthropic (`usage.input_tokens/output_tokens`) shapes, streaming and non-streaming. #81 (thanks @mhajder).
- **Per-request model-name pass-through for external backends** — the proxy honors the inbound `model` against external OpenAI-compatible backends. #80 (thanks @mhajder).
- **Dockerfile** for running the proxy as a container. #79 (thanks @mhajder).

### Changed
- **`last_usage` unified on slot-keyed `{slot_id: TokenUsage}` across all clients.** `AnthropicClient` previously stored a flat `{input_tokens, output_tokens}` dict; it now uses the slot-0 convention `LlamafileClient` / `OllamaClient` already follow, so usage extraction has one contract.
- **Inbound `model` rides the proxy's passthrough/extras channel** rather than the sampling map — a cleaner replacement for the #80 mechanism that keeps `model` out of `sampling`.

### Fixed
- **Proxy no longer hard-imports the optional `anthropic` SDK at load.** A plain `forge-guardrails` install (without the `[anthropic]` extra) can now start the proxy for local / OpenAI-shape backends; the SDK is imported lazily and only required for `--backend-protocol anthropic`.
- **Proxy router tolerates query strings.** Requests like Claude Code's `POST /v1/messages?beta=true` route correctly instead of returning 404.
- **`eval_runner` token accounting for local backends** — was silently counting zero tokens because it read the flat `last_usage` keys; now reads the slot-keyed `TokenUsage` (fixed by the unification above).

### Known limitations
- **`cache_control` is not preserved on Path 2.** OpenAI Chat Completions has no analog, so prompt-cache hints are dropped when the downstream is a local OpenAI-shape backend. Path 1 (Anthropic-shape downstream) preserves `cache_control` on clean turns. See ADR-015.
- **Prompt-mode multi-turn tool convergence is model-dependent.** Some models reliably consume prompt-injected tool results across turns; others re-call the same tool. Native FC is the more robust default for heavy multi-turn tool use (e.g. Claude Code).

## [0.7.0] — 2026-05-22

### Added
- **Granite 4.1 8B + Gemma-4-E4B + phi-4** — added to the eval lineup. Granite 4.1 mirrors the IBM greedy-decoding convention pending formal published sampling guidance; phi-4 has no formal sampling recommendation and falls through to backend defaults.
- **`_PROMPT_ONLY_MODELS` in `batch_eval`** — skips native FC for models lacking training for the OpenAI `tool_calls` schema (currently: phi-4, verified via curl 2026-05-14).
- **`_NO_RECOMMENDED_SAMPLING_MODELS` in `batch_eval`** — runs `recommended_sampling=False` for models without formal sampling guidance from any official source, so the eval doesn't raise `UnsupportedModelError` on them.
- **`MODEL_REGISTRY.md`** — new doc enumerating every model forge knows about, classified as Current (in v0.7.0 eval), Retired (cut from current eval), or Unpublished (sampling params staged, no published eval). Sampling values, source links, identity-key conventions.
- **Versioned eval datasets** — committed dataset files renamed to `eval_results_vX.Y.Z.jsonl`. Prior versions kept in LFS for reproducibility.
- **`report.py` `--html` + `--markdown` flags surfaced** in README and EVAL_GUIDE examples.

### Changed
- **Step enforcement + prerequisite violations surface on the tool channel.** Previously, `WorkflowRunner` emitted these as trailing `role="user"` nudges after the assistant `tool_call`. v0.7.0 emits one `role="tool"` message per blocked call with `[StepEnforcementError]` / `[PrereqError]` prefixes — the canonical "tool call failed, try again" wire shape OpenAI-tool-trained models are pretrained on. Surfaced by v4 forge-code dogfooding (gpt-oss-120b reliably exhausted prerequisite-violation budget under the old shape).
- **Unknown-tool retry on the tool channel.** Same refactor applied to `ResponseValidator` unknown-tool path: `[UnknownToolError]` tool-error reply instead of a user nudge.
- **Eval lineup refresh** — cut Llama 3.1 8B, Mistral 7B v0.3, Mistral Nemo 12B, Granite 4.0 (h-micro / h-tiny). All scored bare <30% on the v0.6.0 dataset — too weak to be informative, superseded by Ministral-3 / Granite 4.1 / phi-4. Sampling defaults retained in `sampling_defaults.py` for backward compatibility (see MODEL_REGISTRY Retired tier).
- **Eval dataset** — `eval_results_v0.7.0.jsonl` (96,200 rows, 74 cells; rig-01). Apples-to-apples delta on 21 common configs vs v0.6.0: +0.7pt overall, -1.2pt advanced_reasoning — both within CI. Published-leaderboard floor lifts +16.9pt via composition (weak-model cuts).
- **Dashboard + markdown views regenerated** against v0.7.0 dataset. Top of leaderboard reshuffled: Ministral-3 14B Reasoning Q4 LS/N now #1 at 84.5% (was Ministral-3 8B Instruct Q8 LS/P at 86.5% in v0.6.0; now #3 at 84.4%).
- **MODEL_GUIDE rewrite** — trimmed to opinions + rationale (333 → 145 lines). Full leaderboard, OG-18 100% list, hard suite top-5, models-to-avoid tables moved to the dashboard / markdown views. Sampling-parameters and "backend matters" sections retained. Native-vs-prompt heuristic corrected: not workload-driven, sensitivity is per-family.
- **ARCHITECTURE rebuild** — cut signature restating (1701 → 165 lines); the doc now covers design principles, surface modes, guardrail rationale, compaction priority rationale, respond-tool rationale, sampling opt-in semantics. Source is authoritative for class signatures; WORKFLOW.md owns the diagrams; ADRs own past decisions.
- **BACKEND_SETUP rewrite** — cut model-pick prose, Windows-specific install steps, Ollama Modelfile tutorial, llamafile distribution explainer, per-backend "run the eval" subsections, VRAM tables (360 → 135 lines). Per-backend section now: boot command + flag table + curl smoke-test + forge client snippet. Added Anthropic section using `pip install "forge-guardrails[anthropic]"`.
- **README opener** — leads with the contract (any tools, any order; structure opt-in via `required_steps`/`prerequisites`/`terminal_tool`) before the eval pitch. New "What forge isn't" (not an agent orchestrator, not a coding harness) preempts the conflations that surfaced on HN. Three-ways list reordered with proxy first (most popular entry point). Quick Start swapped from Ollama to llama-server.

### Fixed
- **WorkflowRunner docstring + tree** — added missing `retry_nudge` kwarg, `cancel_event` parameter on `run()`, `PREREQUISITE_NUDGE` + `CONTEXT_WARNING` message types, `MaxIterationsError` / `PrerequisiteError` / `StepEnforcementError` / `WorkflowCancelledError` in Raises lists across docs.
- **CompactStrategy + ContextManager signatures in docs** — `trigger_tokens` → `budget_tokens` (the strategy owns its own threshold logic now); `compact_threshold` → `context_thresholds` + `on_context_threshold` callbacks.
- **`LlamafileClient` constructor docs** — added missing sampling kwargs (`top_p`, `top_k`, `min_p`, `repeat_penalty`, `presence_penalty`), `chat_template_kwargs`, `slot_id`.
- **MODEL_FAMILIES in `report.py`** — added entries for `granite-4.1-8b` (Q4/Q8) and `phi-4-Q4_K_M` so cross-backend rollups in `by-backend.md` group these new models correctly.
- **WORKFLOW.md agentic-loop flowchart** — node names + edges updated to reflect the tool-error wire shape (`STEP_TOOL_ERROR`, `PREREQ_TOOL_ERROR`, `UNKNOWN_TOOL_ERROR`); compaction-priority table fixed (`step_nudge` and `prerequisite_nudge` are `role=tool`, `retry_nudge` remains `role=user`).
- **Stale `bfcl/` reference** removed from WORKFLOW.md module diagram (directory was removed pre-v0.7.0; ADR-009 retained as historical artifact).

### Known limitations
- **Anthropic numbers not re-measured in v0.7.0.** The Anthropic ablation matrix (~$272 to run) was not re-executed for v0.7.0. Numbers cited in any v0.7.0 doc are from the v0.6.0 dataset (`eval_results_v0.6.0.jsonl`). Tool-error-channel changes affect frontier models' wire on guardrail-fire paths too, but expected movement is small.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-04-29

### Added
- **Per-model sampling defaults** — `forge.clients.sampling_defaults` ships a verified per-model recommendations map (Qwen3/3.5/3.6, Qwen3-Coder, Gemma 4, Mistral Small 3.2, Devstral Small 2, Ministral 3 Instruct + Reasoning, Mistral Nemo, Granite 4.0). Each row carries an inline HuggingFace card URL; values are verified one entry at a time, no extrapolation. Opt in via `recommended_sampling=True` on `OllamaClient` / `LlamafileClient`. Closes #58, #59, #61.
- **`UnsupportedModelError`** — `recommended_sampling=True` against a model not in the map raises rather than falling through to backend defaults silently.
- **Per-call sampling overrides** — `send()` and `send_stream()` accept a `sampling: dict | None` kwarg that merges field-by-field with the client's instance-level sampling without mutating it. Caller's explicit non-None fields win.
- **Proxy sampling pass-through** — proxy plumbs OpenAI-compatible body fields (`temperature`, `top_p`, `top_k`, `min_p`, `repeat_penalty`, `presence_penalty`, `seed`) through to the backend per request, never mutating the proxy's pre-built client. To get card-recommended sampling in proxy mode, the calling client looks up `forge.clients.get_sampling_defaults(model)` and includes the values in the request body.
- **Advanced reasoning eval suite** — 8 new scenarios under the `advanced_reasoning` tag (lambda + stateful pairs): `data_gap_recovery_extended`, `argument_transformation`, `inconsistent_api_recovery`, `grounded_synthesis`. Designed as top-tier separators after the sampling-params fix lifted 8B-class to 100% on the OG-18 suite.
- **Multi-rig eval dataset** — 119,600 rows across 46 configs × 26 scenarios × 2 ablations × 50 runs, consolidated from 4 rigs (rig-00..rig-03). Each row carries a `rig` field for hardware provenance; rig topology in `eval_rigs.json` at repo root.
- **Dashboard Suite scope** — orthogonal to the statefulness scope; slice between `all` / `og18` / `advanced_reasoning` with all aggregates recomputed from per-scenario data.
- **Granite 4.0 support** — `granite-4.0:h-micro-q4_K_M` and `granite-4.0:h-tiny-q4_K_M` in the sampling-defaults map (greedy decoding, T=0, secondary source citing IBM).

### Changed
- **Dropped hardcoded `temperature=0.7`** — `OllamaClient` and `LlamafileClient` no longer ship a hardcoded sampling default. With `recommended_sampling=False` (default), forge sends nothing and the backend's default applies. Caller-supplied kwargs always win.
- **`AnthropicClient`** — no longer sends a hardcoded temperature; the API's own defaults apply (Claude is frontier-optimized; forge uses it as a baseline-comparison tool).
- **Eval scenarios trimmed** — 18 → 26 across the consolidated dataset (18 OG + 8 advanced_reasoning).
- **MODEL_GUIDE** — restructured around three difficulty tiers (mechanical / mid / hard), with hard ≡ advanced_reasoning. Top recommendations updated to reflect 119K-row consolidated dataset; Ministral-3 dominates the 12GB tier, all top-10 configs run on llama-server.
- **`__version__`** — exposed on the `forge` package via `importlib.metadata`.

### Fixed
- Stray `git add .` could pick up rig-local `eval_results_rig*.jsonl` files; explicit LFS pattern keeps them tracked when intentional, ignored otherwise.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-04-19

### Added
- **Ablation study runner** — `scripts/run_ablation.py` runs models × guardrail presets sequentially with retry logic; designed for unattended overnight or travel runs.
- **N=50 ablation rollout** — full ablation study expanded to N=50, generating the IEEE preprint dataset.
- **Three-screen dashboard** — restructured around three audiences:
  - *Reforged* — one row per config ("which model do I run?")
  - *Reforged vs Bare* — paired per config ("how much does forge lift it?")
  - *Full Ablation* — 7 ablation variants per deep-ablated config ("which guardrail is doing the work?")
  - Three-screen split is also structurally necessary: reforged + bare is collected universally, while the full 7-way sweep only exists for one best-backend-per-model config.
- **12GB tier coverage extension** — 8 new 12GB configs (Ministral 8B Instruct Q4/Q8, 8B Reasoning Q8, 14B Reasoning Q4, Llama 3.1 8B Q4/Q8, Mistral 7B Q4/Q8) × 5 presets, N=50.
- **Granite 4.0 support** — `extract_tool_call` accepts OpenAI-style `{"name": ..., "arguments": ...}` keys (Granite emits this wrapped in `<tool_call>` tags). h-micro and h-tiny configs added to GGUF_MAP.
- **Statistical significance script** — `tests/eval/significance.py` computes pooled McNemar's test + Wilson 95% CI per ablation cell, paired on (scenario, run) against the reforged baseline. Intended for paper-table validation.
- **Batch eval timeout** — 300s wall-clock cap per scenario at all 3 call sites; on timeout the run is recorded as `completeness=False, error_type='Timeout'` and the batch keeps moving. 4 timeouts across 40,500 runs in the full study — safety net, not a scoring factor.
- **`--models-dir` CLI flag** on the ablation runner; replaces the hardcoded path.

### Changed
- **Markdown report layout** — split into `reforged/` subdir (all, by-family, by-backend), plus `reforged-vs-bare.md`, `ablation.md` (rewritten as 7-row grouped towers), `native-vs-prompt.md`, `budget.md`. Per-backend files dropped — duplicated dashboard work.
- **Dashboard sample-data fallback removed** — production builds always inject `window.__FORGE_DATA__` via `report.py`; the dev hot-reload path is gone.

### Fixed
- **llama.cpp reasoning budget hang** (issue #54) — builds after April 10 2026 activate an unbounded reasoning budget sampler for Gemma 4, Qwen 3.5, and Ministral Reasoning models, causing silent hangs. Document `--reasoning-budget 0` workaround in BACKEND_SETUP.md and MODEL_GUIDE.md.

### Removed
- **Granite 3.3** configs from GGUF_MAP — native FC is broken on llama.cpp for that version. Granite 4.0 (h-micro, h-tiny) retained.

## [0.4.3] — 2026-04-17

### Added
- **Qwen Coder XML rescue parsing** — rescue_tool_call now recognizes `<function=name><parameter=key>value</parameter></function>` format emitted by Qwen3-Coder and similar models (issue #55). Regex patterns adapted from Qwen's reference parser.

## [0.4.2] — 2026-04-10

### Added
- **28-model eval dataset** — 137K rows across Gemma4, Qwen3.5, Devstral, Mistral Small 3.2, Claude Opus/Sonnet 4.6, and more
- **32GB eval tier** — dual RTX 5070 Ti results; Gemma4 31B and Qwen3.5 27B hit 100% self-hosted
- **Git LFS tracking** — eval_results.jsonl tracked via LFS for cross-rig sharing
- **forge-proxy CLI** — `forge-proxy` entry point in `[project.scripts]`
- **codecov integration** — CI coverage reporting and badge

### Changed
- MODEL_GUIDE rewritten for 28-model dataset with 12GB and 32GB VRAM tiers
- Removed BFCL benchmark (historical reference in EVAL_GUIDE, last commit: a9b0257)
- Eval scenarios consolidated to 22 (18 copy-paste + 4 compaction-chain), pruned of redundant variants

### Fixed
- Server readiness: `_wait_healthy()` polls `/props` instead of `/health` to eliminate 503 race on startup (v0.4.1)
- Null byte corruption in eval_results.jsonl from interrupted write

## [0.4.0] — 2026-04-02

### Added
- **SlotWorker** — priority-queued shared slot access for multi-slot llama-server configurations
- **Tool prerequisites** — conditional tool dependencies (`ToolDef.prerequisites`) with arg-matched enforcement
- **Workflow cancellation** — `cancel_event` parameter on `WorkflowRunner.run()` with `WorkflowCancelledError`
- **Multiple terminal tools** — `Workflow.terminal_tools` accepts a set of tool names
- **Custom retry nudges** — `WorkflowRunner` and `Guardrails` accept caller-provided nudge text
- **KV unified support** — `--kv-unified` flag passthrough, FORGE_FAST multi-slot budget fix
- **Compaction chain eval** — 4-scenario degradation curve (baseline/P1/P2/P3) for 10-step dependency chains
- **Proxy unit tests** — 54 tests covering handler, convert, and server modules
- **Real token counting** — backends report actual token usage for compaction decisions

### Changed
- Removed `trust_text_intent` and `TextResponse.intentional` — respond tool pattern supersedes
- Eval scenarios trimmed from 29 to 22 (removed redundant compaction variants)
- Long-running session advisory added to User Guide (transient message filtering)

### Fixed
- FORGE_FAST double-divides context when `n_slots > 1`
- Replaced `FORGE_MODELS_DIR` env var with `--models-dir` CLI arg

## [0.3.0] — 2026-03-12

### Added
- **Proxy server** — OpenAI-compatible drop-in proxy with automatic respond tool injection
- **Guardrails middleware** — composable middleware for foreign orchestration loops
- **Anthropic client** — frontier baseline backend
- **Eval harness** — 22 scenarios, batch runner, BFCL benchmark integration
- **Context thresholds** — configurable warning callbacks at budget percentages
- **TieredCompact** — three-phase compaction strategy (truncate → drop results → sliding window)

### Changed
- Context management rewritten with VRAM-aware budget resolution via `setup_backend()`

## [0.2.0] — 2026-02-15

### Added
- **WorkflowRunner** — agentic tool-calling loop with retry logic
- **ResponseValidator** — rescue parsing for malformed tool calls
- **StepEnforcer** — required step and terminal tool enforcement
- **OllamaClient** and **LlamafileClient** — local model backends
- **ServerManager** — automatic llama-server lifecycle management

## [0.1.0] — 2026-01-20

- Initial release — core framework with tool-calling loop, basic guardrails, Ollama backend
